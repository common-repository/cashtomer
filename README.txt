Boost your sales 5x faster through our powerful and easy-to-use loyalty plugin. Reward your customers for sign-up, social shares, and purchases.

== Description ==

**Most loyalty programs suck** because they are troublesome to enroll, painful to implement and difficult to remember.

Ultimately, customers tend to ignore the loyalty program and your shop fails to stand out from the fierce competition. There are chances that you might lose your customers despite having decent products. 

Understanding all these problems, we have built Cashtomer to help you boost your brand growth through our intuitive loyalty program.

>It costs 5x more to attract a new customer than it does to retain an existing customer. Use Cashtomer to boost customer retention and turn your customers into your brand ambassadors.

**Cashtomer works only with WooCommerce shops**
